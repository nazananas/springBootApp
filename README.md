# springBootApp
This is an educational web application using Java (SpringBoot), JavaScript (React), PostgreSQL, and Redis. It is made for training the implementation of DevOps tools and practices for regular (non-DevOps) projects. Soon I will add here the name of the repository with this project, only with the implementation of DevOps practices and tools.
